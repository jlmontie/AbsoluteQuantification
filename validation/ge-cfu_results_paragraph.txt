The Explify UTI v1 Test was used to analyze 89 residual patient samples with microorganism concentrations determined by culture. The ARUP MC U Quantitative Urine Culture Test and subsequent manual plate counting was used to provide quantitative colony-forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL) estimates for each sample. A strong correlation was observed between the two quantification methods with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 (Figure X). A linear regression was fit to the data to describe the general relationship between [GE/ml] calculated with the Explify UTI v1 Test and [CFU/ml]. This relationship is summarized in Table Y.

The Explify v2.1 Platformâ€™s quantification computation was validated with a set of 15 contrived sequencing datasets with expected molecular quantification results. Simulated IC reads were combined with simulated 16S/18S rDNA reads in known ratios. All quantification results passed the specified criteria with observed quantifications within 0.5 log10 of expected concentrations (Table X). In addition, organism detection was not observed where organisms were not simulated (Quant Dataset Q-IC) and no quantification was provided where IC was not simulated (Quant Dataset Q-Mixed-Mid-No-IC).
