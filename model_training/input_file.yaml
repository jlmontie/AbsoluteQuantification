# Model training input files
# Three input files are required:
#
# 1) FastQataloguerOutput. The path to the "Export Table" output from
# FastQataloguer (fastqataloguer.idbydna.com). This file should include only
# the dilution series samples for which the absolute quantification model
# should be trained.
# 2) OrganismStockConcentrations. The path to a comma-separated file
# with at least the folowing columns describing each organism in the sample:
#  taxid (organism taxid)
#  organism (organism name)
#  stock_concentration (the initial concentration of each organism in the mix)
# 3) SampleDilutionFactors. The path to a comma-separated file describing the
# dilution factors for each sample. The following columns are required:
#  Accession (the accession number of the sample)
#  Dilution Factor (the dilution factor for the sample, e.g. 10 for a 10X dil)
